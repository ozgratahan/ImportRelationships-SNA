IMPORT RELATIONSHIPS OF EUROPEAN COUNTRY- Social Network Analysis

Project Overview:

This project focuses on analyzing the import relationships among European countries using Social Network Analysis (SNA). The goal is to examine how countries interact with each other through imports, providing a deeper understanding of trade networks in Europe. The analysis involves calculating centrality measures for each country, visualizing the network, and deriving insights from both individual and global measures.

Data Description:

The dataset consists of import data between European countries. The data is structured in the following format:

Source Country: The country exporting goods.

Target Country: The country importing goods.

Weight: The volume or value of imports between the countries.

The dataset covers import relations for a specified year or time period, with a focus on the intensity of imports among countries.


Analysis Focus:

Measures:

Indegree: The number of countries that import from a specific country.

Outdegree: The number of countries a specific country exports to.

Betweenness Centrality: Measures the influence of a country as an intermediary in trade relationships.

Closeness Centrality: Reflects how easily a country can reach other countries in the trade network
